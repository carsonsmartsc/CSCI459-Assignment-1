# Choice of Database Management System

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

A simple database to:

1. Serve as a sandbox for CSCI-459
2. Perform CRUD operations
3. Provide the foundation for future projects in class

# Decision:

MySQL is a very common and straight-forward database that integrates well with Wordpress. According to datanyze.com, MySQL has a market share of 44.59%. 

# Consequences: 

It is very simple to setup a MySQL (MariaDB) environment. 
I have experience using MariaDB in my CSCI-315 class.
