# Docker Capabilities and Overview

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Docker is a computer program that performs containerization. These containers are isolated from one another and bundle together to create powerful systems. 

# Decision:

I have decided to use Docker containers for this system because they are very lightweight and scale easily. Docker containers are currently one of the most common platforms used in industry. 

 
# Consequences: 

Containers do not run at bare-metal speeds but the speed currently provided is more than sufficient for this project.
