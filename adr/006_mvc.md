# Model-view-controller Overview

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

The Model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern is commonly used to separate information and how the data is presented to the user. Separating these components allows for efficient code reuse and parallel development. 

# Decision:

Wordpress does not by default implement MVC but there is a plugin to implement this functionality. I will not be implementing this plugin because it is not necessary for this project.  

 
# Consequences: 

MVC is generally a good architecture to abide by and will prevent this system from running in parallel development.
