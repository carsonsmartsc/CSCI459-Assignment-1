# Choice of Content Management System

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

A simple web application with a database to:

1. Serve as a sandbox for CSCI-459
2. Perform CRUD operations
3. Provide the foundation for future projects in class

# Decision:

Wordpress is a well known, easy to use environment that requires a MySQL (MariaDB) database. According to datanyze.com, Wordpress has a market share of 82.11%.


# Consequences: 

It was very simple and straightforward to start a Wordpress site with MySQL (only two containers needed). 
I have used Wordpress before for ImpactX at the College of Charleston.
